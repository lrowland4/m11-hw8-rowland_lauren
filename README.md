i. 	I had and issue step d. linking to lib did not allow  me to veiw 		content in the browswer becuase I was editing the main.js in my src 	folder, so I linked that instead. Am I supposed to put the 				javaScript in both places?

ii. Used this website you sent me to help set up Babel. Other than that 	no outside resources were used.
